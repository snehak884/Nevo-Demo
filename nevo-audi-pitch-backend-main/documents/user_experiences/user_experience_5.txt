So last weekend, Sam and I packed up our new Škoda Superb for a spontaneous road trip along the coast—our trusty gray beauty did not disappoint. Now, I've had hatchbacks and sedans before, but the luggage space in this thing is like the TARDIS; you wouldn't believe how much we crammed in without breaking a sweat. And get this, even with all our camping gear and two bikes, we still had room for our inflatable kayak! The drive itself was a dream—I'm a sucker for the 'Comfort' mode, but Sam switched it to 'Sport' the moment we hit those twisty seaside roads, and it was like the car hugged each curve just for us. Oh, and the 13'' infotainment system kept us navigated and entertained, not to mention we caught our favorite online radio station halfway through nowhere. Also, there was this one moment when we needed to back into a tight camping spot with our trailer, and with the "Trailer Assist," it was so simple that even Sam gave up his usually sarcastic commentary. Seriously, it's like every part of this car is engineered to make little adventures feel epic.
