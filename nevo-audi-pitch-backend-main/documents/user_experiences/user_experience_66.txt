Last weekend, we took our new Škoda Kodiaq for a little family road trip to the mountains, and let me tell you, it was a game-changer. Sarah and I loved the lane-keeping assist, especially during the winding roads; it felt like the car was gently guiding us along the way. Our kids, Olivia and Max, were glued to their favorite tunes thanks to the incredible CANTON sound system—honestly, they've never been so quiet during a drive! Even setting up the dashcam was a breeze with that rearview mirror USB-C port; no more dangling cables all over the place. But the cherry on top was how the car stayed seamlessly connected to the internet, giving us real-time traffic updates and keeping us on the best route. Long story short, the trip was smooth, safe, and actually fun for once!
