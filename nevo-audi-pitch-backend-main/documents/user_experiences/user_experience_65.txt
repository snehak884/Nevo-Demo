Last weekend, we took our brand new Škoda Enyaq Coupé on its maiden family road trip, and it was just what we needed to break free from the daily grind. Sara and I packed up the kids, Lucas and Emma, and headed for the countryside. The Enyaq's all-electric 77 kWh battery made the 500 km round trip feel like a breeze — not worrying about CO₂ emissions made me feel I was doing my bit for the planet, too. The panoramic glass roof kept the kids entertained, watching clouds race above us, and the sleek design made me feel like we were in a sci-fi movie. The evasive assistant even saved us when a stray dog ran into the road; it calculated the perfect evasive move, and we safely avoided it without a hitch. Lucas named it our "evasive superhero"! We loaded up the trunk with all our picnic gear, and the flexible trunk bag for the charging cable made sure we had extra space for Emma's endless supply of stuffed animals. We spent the afternoon hiking and laughing by the lake, creating memories that felt like pure everyday magic. Can't wait for our next adventure in this incredible car!
