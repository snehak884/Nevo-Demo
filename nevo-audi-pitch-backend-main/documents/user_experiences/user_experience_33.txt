You wouldn't believe the adventures Emma and I have had in our new Škoda Kodiaq! Just the other weekend, we decided to take an impromptu road trip to a national park neither of us had ever visited. The comfort of those front seats made the journey feel like we were gliding through clouds, even when we detoured onto some rather questionable (okay, downright rugged) side roads. The CANTON sound system filled the cabin with our curated playlist, each note crisp and clear—better than any live concert we've ever been to. We even managed to have a mini dance party at a scenic overlook, thanks to that back seat being so easy to fold down for an impromptu open-air venue. Honestly, it feels like a spaceship with ambient lighting that makes every midnight drive magical. And when it started to rain cats and dogs just as we were about to set up camp, that touchless tailgate opening came to the rescue, letting us toss our stuff in without getting soaked.
