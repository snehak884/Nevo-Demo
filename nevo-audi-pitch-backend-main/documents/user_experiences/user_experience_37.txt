Last weekend, we packed the kids into our new Škoda Octavia Combi and set off on one of our spontaneous family adventures. Who knew a quick trip to the countryside could turn into such an exhilarating day? The kids were busy gaping at the panoramic roof, trying to point out cloud shapes as my husband skillfully navigated using the real-time Infotainment Online system. At one point, we got lost and started feeling a bit panicked, but the Care Connect feature saved the day! We tapped a few buttons on the MyŠkoda App and, voila, we were back on track. Even when little Emma spilled her juice in the back, the double-sided luggage compartment mat made the cleanup a breeze. By the end of the trip, our Octavia felt like another member of the family, effortlessly adapting to every hiccup and turning them into memorable moments. And honestly, anyone who has kids knows how rare and valuable that is!
