I'm still buzzing from our recent road trip in the Škoda Superb! We decided to surprise the kids with a weekend getaway to the countryside – you know, a bit of a digital detox. The kids were belting out their favorite songs, and I have to say, the CANTON Sound System is something else; it's like having a concert in your car. The best part? Absolutely zero arguments about the air conditioning. With the three-zone settings, everyone found their sweet spot – I stayed cool, Sarah cranked up the heat, and the kids fiddled with theirs without a fuss. The connectivity features were a lifesaver too, giving us real-time traffic updates and smooth directions right to our cozy little B&B. Oh, and those clever little touches? I used the umbrella compartment more times than I thought I would because, well, it was British weather! Honestly, it felt like the car was part of the family adventure and not just a mode of transport.
