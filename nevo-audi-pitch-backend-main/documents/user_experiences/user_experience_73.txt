So, we decided to take a spontaneous family road trip last weekend. Our new Škoda Enyaq Coupé had barely a hundred miles on it, and we just couldn't wait to test out all its fancy features. The kids were excited about the spacious backseat with its nifty pockets for their tablets and snacks. My husband, ever the tech enthusiast, geeked out over the footwell lighting and the multicolored ambient lights. It felt like we were driving a spaceship rather than a car! As for me, I adored the heated, leather sports steering wheel—it made me feel like a racecar driver, even when I was just adjusting the recuperation strength. We ended up driving through the countryside, with no particular destination in mind. The smooth electric drive and the all-wheel traction were absolute bliss on winding roads. By the time we stopped for a picnic, our Enyaq's trunk had swallowed up all our gear effortlessly. The sun protection blinds kept the rear side windows cool, making our little impromptu adventure not just bearable, but downright delightful. I never thought a Sunday drive could feel so much like an adventure!
