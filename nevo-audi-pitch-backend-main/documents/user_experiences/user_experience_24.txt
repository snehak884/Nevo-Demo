So, last week Mark and I finally took out our new Škoda Enyaq-85x Sportline for a weekend getaway, and let me tell you, it was a revelation. We're both in our late 30s, married, no kids yet, but we do have our beloved dog Moose, who’s basically our child. The road trip to our friend's cottage was always fun, but this time, it was next-level. The heated front seats were a total blessing for the chilly morning start, and Mark couldn’t stop raving about the lumbar support for his back—he even said it was the most comfortable ride ever. The Climatronic air conditioning made sure we were in our own little micro-climate despite the varying weather outside. I especially appreciated the travel assist features; it felt like the car was practically reading my mind, making the drive so much easier and, dare I say, enjoyable. Oh, and let’s not forget the keyless access system—goodbye fumbling for keys in big purses! We had all our gadgets charged up too, thanks to those clever USB-C ports. Moose loved the spacious back, and with the electric tailgate operation, loading and unloading our bags was a breeze. Seriously, this car has transformed our simple weekend trips to mini-adventures, and I can't wait for our next journey!
