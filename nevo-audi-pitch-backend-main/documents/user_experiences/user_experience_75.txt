Justine, a 33-year-old architect from Vancouver, bought herself a Škoda Kodiaq and has been on the most liberating solo adventures ever since. Last week, she decided on an impromptu weekend trip to Whistler. As someone who loves the serenity of the mountains but dreads driving in winter conditions, the Kodiaq's winter package was a true blessing. Not only did she appreciate not having to scrape off ice from her windows early in the morning, but the heated seats and all-wheel drive made the winding snowy roads feel like a breeze. On the way, she discovered a charming little coffee shop she never knew existed—thanks to the 13-inch infotainment system that recommended nearby gems. Justine laughs when she recalls getting lost in an accidental detour, only to find herself at a stunning, lesser-known viewpoint. Suspended above snowy treetops and clear blue sky, she realized that the Kodiaq hadn't just taken her on a drive; it had led her to a hidden treasure. And with the Matrix LED lights cutting through the dense forest fog, the drive back felt just as exciting as the journey there.
