Last weekend, our family embarked on a spontaneous trip to the countryside in our new Škoda Enyaq Coupé, and let me tell you, it was a revelation. As we meandered through winding roads lined with autumn leaves, the online infotainment system kept us engaged with a mix of sing-along anthems and fascinating podcasts—perfect for keeping the kids entertained. The adjustable lumbar support in the front seats saved my back during the drive, and the full LED rear lights guided us safely home as dusk settled in. We even found a hidden gem of a café thanks to the real-time traffic and weather updates. The best part? No more fussing with mechanical child locks; we just activated the electronic child safety lock from the driver’s seat whenever we stopped for a quick photo op. It was one of those days where every little feature of the car felt like it was designed just for us, turning an ordinary family outing into an unforgettable adventure.
