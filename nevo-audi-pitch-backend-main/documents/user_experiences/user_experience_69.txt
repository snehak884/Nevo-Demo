Last weekend was pure magic, thanks to our new Škoda Enyaq Coupé. You know, when Sharon and I decided to splurge on a new family car, we weren't expecting it to transform our road trips into mini-adventures, but boy, were we wrong! The kids absolutely loved the Canton Sound System. As we cruised along the coastline, we switched between rock and philharmonic modes—whatever the kids fought less over! Stopping off for a picnic, I felt a bit smug as I easily reconfigured the flexible trunk to secure our mountain of food and toys. And laughter? Oh, it was endless! Especially when the tiny turning circle allowed me to pull off a cheeky U-turn without spilling Dad's "roadside food truck" of hotdogs. Seriously, who knew a car could make even the simplest family outing feel like an epic journey? Cheryl and Timmy are already planning our next adventure—perhaps we’ll even venture to Grandma’s, zero emissions and all!
