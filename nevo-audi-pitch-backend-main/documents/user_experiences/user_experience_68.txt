Last summer, we finally decided to upgrade our family car to the Škoda Kodiaq, and let me tell you, it’s been an absolute game-changer. Picture this: My wife, our two kids, and I packed up for a weekend trip to the coast. The drive was a dream – no more fighting over who gets to use the USB ports because the Kodiaq has five of them! And I can't emphasize enough how handy the USB-C port in the rearview mirror has been for our dashcam; no messy wires obstructing the view! The kids stayed entertained with their tablets charging in the backseat, and my wife and I got to enjoy some uninterrupted time while the smart tailgate made loading and unloading a breeze. The cherry on top? When I nearly dozed off after lunch (thank you, beach sun!), the Emergency Assist gently nudged me awake, pulling the car safely to a stop when I didn't respond—talk about a lifesaver! It's like the Kodiaq has become an extra member of our family, making every journey safer and more fun.
