I’ve got to tell you about my totally unexpected "mini-adventure" last weekend with my new Škoda Kodiaq. Picture this: it’s me, Maria, a 38-year-old freelance graphic designer with a love for spontaneous road trips. I decided on a whim to take the Kodiaq out for a spin towards the lake for some sketches. Imagine my delight when I found that the massage seats and three-zone climate control made me feel like I was driving a first-class cabin on wheels! And get this – I actually used the USB-C port in the rearview mirror for my dashcam. It was super convenient, ensuring I captured the scenic roads without those annoying cables everywhere. At one point, some overly ambitious driver zoomed up behind me, but the lane change assistant alerted me well in advance. Seriously, it was like the car had my back! By the time I reached the lake, it felt like I'd been on a refreshing retreat rather than a two-hour drive. Couldn’t help but stay parked a little longer just to soak it all in. Highly recommend a bit of aimless adventure in a Kodiaq!
