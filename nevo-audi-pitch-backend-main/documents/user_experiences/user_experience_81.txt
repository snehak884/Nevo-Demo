Last weekend was one of those unexpectedly magical family adventures! We just got our new Škoda Enyaq Coupé, and even loading the kids in for our first little road trip felt like an event. The highlight was when we hit the highway—my husband, Dave, suggested I give the lane change assistant a try. Skeptical but curious, I flicked the turn signal, and the car simply glided into the next lane as smoothly as if it had been waiting all its life to do just that. The kids in the back were more impressed with the giant infotainment screen in the front than the seamless driving magic. Having the AR Head-up Display was like having a futuristic co-pilot; it gave me all the necessary info without making me take my eyes off the road. Of course, Dave found it hilarious to impersonate a flight attendant, announcing the traffic signs before the system could display them. All in all, this new Škoda Enyaq Coupé turned our mundane grocery run into a family adventure to remember!
