Yesterday was one of those quintessential family days that's become a bit of a tradition for us—our annual trek to the countryside for some apple picking. We recently got the new Škoda Octavia Combi, and let me tell you, the adventure started the moment we hit the road. My back usually protests on long drives, but with these AGR-certified seats, I felt like I was lounging in a high-end recliner, not driving a car. Even the kids commented on the comfy back seats, and that’s saying something! And let's not forget, my husband finally didn’t need to ask which fuel to use, thanks to the clever anti-misfueling feature. The cherry on top? The semi-automatic cargo cover that made seamlessly loading and unloading our apple haul a breeze—no more wrestling with the trunk while balancing a toddler. I honestly can't remember a more smooth, enjoyable day trip.
