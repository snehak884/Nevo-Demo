Just last weekend, Karen and her husband bundled up their twins, Emma and Jake, for a spontaneous trip to the countryside in their new Škoda Superb. Karen had always had a soft spot for impromptu adventures, but with two energetic six-year-olds, it's often more chaos than calm. That day, however, she felt differently. The car's numerous connectivity options kept the kids entertained, allowing Karen to lean back into the plush, knee-padded console with relief. The journey was smooth thanks to the Dynamic Chassis Control Plus, and it felt as if their vehicle had intuitively known when to shift from Comfort to Sport mode on those winding country roads. Maybe it was the laughter of the kids in the backseat or the ease with which her husband handled even the trickiest of parking spots using the parking assistance—Karen couldn't quite put her finger on it. But as the family arrived at an untouched meadow and tumbled out with their picnic basket, she couldn't help but feel they'd uncovered a little slice of magic.
