So, last weekend we decided to pack the kids and the dog into our new Škoda Superb for a spontaneous trip to the countryside. I have to say, this car is a game-changer for family adventures. My husband, James, was still a bit nervous about driving on unfamiliar rural roads, but he was absolutely won over by the Surround View Camera. The real-time 180-degree images made maneuvering through narrow lanes and unexpected obstacles feel like playing a video game—safe, fun, and totally stress-free. Meanwhile, the kids were in the back asking Laura, the voice assistant, endless questions in different languages just to see if she would trip up (spoiler alert: she didn’t). And me? I was just enjoying the fact that we didn’t have to stop ten times to ask for directions or break out into arguments over missed turns. Plus, knowing the e Call+ system had our back gave us peace of mind for the entire trip. It’s like this car was designed specifically to make our family outings less chaotic and a lot more adventurous.
