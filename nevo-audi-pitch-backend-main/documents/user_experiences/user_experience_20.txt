You wouldn’t believe the bliss I felt on my first long drive in my new Škoda Superb. I had always dreamed of a car that could turn even the mundane commute into an adventure, and this was it. Picture this – I’m cruising along the motorway on a crisp Saturday morning, with my partner in the passenger seat, sipping on our takeaway coffees. Just as we hit a monstrous traffic jam, I activated the Traffic Jam Assist. Suddenly, my car started, braked, and steered itself in sync with the crawling traffic, and all I had to worry about was the playlist. My partner and I turned up the volume, singing our hearts out without stress. And let's not forget the parking at the park later – awkward parallel spots have always been my nemesis. But with the parking steering assistant and 360° cameras, it was like gliding the car into place with a magician’s wand. Who knew running errands could feel so much like exploring new horizons?
