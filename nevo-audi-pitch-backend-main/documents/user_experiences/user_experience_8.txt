So, you know how Rachel and I love those spontaneous weekend escapes? Well, we found ourselves in this hilly little village last Sunday, thanks to my new Škoda Superb. Honestly, I felt like a pro navigating those sharp bends—XDS+ did its magic, adjusting perfectly to the curves like the car had a brain of its own. It's crazy how intuitive it felt, like the Superb was encouraging me to take on the world one winding road at a time. And the hill-start assist? A godsend. There we were, perched on a steep incline with a breathtaking view, and instead of my usual panic about rolling back, I just let the Superb do its thing. No drama, no juddering stops. I could see Rachel relax beside me, flashing brake lights keeping us safe amidst sudden stops for photos. We ended our adventure with a perfect, stress-free trailer maneuver at the campsite, pulling out our tiny vintage trailer like it was straight out of a rom-com. It's like the Superb is made for making memories, one curve and hill at a time.
