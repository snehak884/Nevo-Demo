As an avid hiker in my thirties, I’ve always thought the journey to the trail was just as important as the hike itself. When I decided to treat myself and buy the Skoda Superb-Essence, I had no idea just how transformative my weekend getaways would become. Last Saturday, driving up a winding mountain road with my partner next to me, the sun dipping behind the peaks, the car’s 10" infotainment system played our favourite road trip playlist effortlessly. The heated seats were a welcomed luxury as the early morning chill crept in, and the ‘surround view’ parking camera made maneuvering through tight, gravelly spots a breeze. We laughed and marveled at how easy everything felt, right down to the rain sensor which saved us from a sudden downpour during a pit stop. It’s more than just a car—it’s like having a thoughtful co-pilot along for the ride, one that makes every trip feel like a new adventure.
