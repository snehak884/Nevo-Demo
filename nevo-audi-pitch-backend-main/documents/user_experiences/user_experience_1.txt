When we took the plunge and bought the new Škoda Octavia Combi, we didn't just get a car – we adopted a new lifestyle. Last weekend, we packed up the kids and headed to the mountains for some fresh air and fun. With plenty of cargo space, our mountain bikes and camping gear fit in easily, leaving the kids with ample room to stretch out. The clever technology made the drive so smooth; the intuitive Travel Assist handled the steep, winding roads like a pro, giving me the confidence to relax and enjoy the ride. My wife loved the heated steering wheel (she gets cold hands so easily), and the LED ambient lighting kept the cabin cozy as the sun set. And when we reached our destination, Remote Parking maneuvered us into a tight spot effortlessly while I stood outside and directed via the MyŠkoda App – the kids watched in awe, already asking when we could do it again. It felt like a seamless blend of everyday convenience and spontaneous adventure, all wrapped in one stylish package.
