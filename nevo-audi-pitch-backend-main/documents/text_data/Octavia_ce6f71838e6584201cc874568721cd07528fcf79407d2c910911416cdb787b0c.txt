Škoda Octavia Combi – Your Number One Choice Airbags and Impact Protection In the event of an accident, all passengers are protected by a robust body with generous crumple zones and up to ten airbags. These work together in precise coordination with the three-point automatic seatbelts and safety headrests. Modern electronic systems further mitigate the consequences. These include, for example, the multi-collision brake and the proactive occupant protection system in the front and rear.
