Škoda Kodiaq – Design Distinctively dynamic silhouette The aerodynamically optimized and elongated roofline, complemented by a flat, silver-painted roof railing, immediately catches the eye in the side view. The side tornado line contributes to the dynamic appearance of the Kodiaq, while the heavily contoured body, which runs over the front and rear wheels and thus accents the wheel arches, emphasizes its robustness. The stylish and powerful design is further enhanced by wheels up to 20 inches in size as well as angular wheel arches and door sills made of textured black plastic.
