Škoda Superb – Assistance Systems Travel Assist If you occasionally sit behind the wheel for hours, you might know how challenging it can be to constantly pay attention to signs, drive in heavy traffic, or stay focused during stop-and-go traffic. The Travel Assist helps you with this and enhances your driving comfort with its systems and functions. Once the functions are activated, the Travel Assist automatically keeps your Škoda in the lane, adjusts the speed, and coordinates braking and starting in traffic situations.
