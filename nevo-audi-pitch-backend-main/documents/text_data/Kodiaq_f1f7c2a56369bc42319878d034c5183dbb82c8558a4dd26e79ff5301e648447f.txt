Škoda Kodiaq – LED Technology LED Tail Lights Even in the standard equipment, Škoda installs LED technology in the tail lights. The optional top version of the tail lights scores with a welcome effect and dynamic indicators (standard for Sportline). These are divided into three segments and shine with a sharpened design and illuminated crystal elements. The new wide C-light signature extends to the middle of the tailgate. Below that, a red light strip with a crystalline structure connects the two rear lights.
