Škoda Kodiaq – Design  Unmistakable dynamic silhouette  The aerodynamically optimized and elongated roofline, which is complemented by a flat, silver-painted roof railing, immediately catches the eye from the side view. The Tornado line running along the side contributes to the dynamic appearance of the Kodiaq, while the strongly contoured body, which runs over the front and rear wheels and thus accentuates the wheel arches, emphasizes its robustness. The stylish and powerful design is reinforced by wheels up to 20" in size, as well as angular wheel arches and door sills made of textured black plastic.
