Škoda Superb – modern design Thoughtful rear section The large tailgate with the generous window gives the vehicle's flowing rear section the look of a coupe. The very narrow LED taillights with animated indicators and welcome effect, which create the model-specific light signature with their shape and crystalline structure, emphasize the attractive and elegant look of the vehicle's rear section. The highlight is the elegantly designed rear bumper with a wide diffuser and new Škoda lettering on the tailgate in unique dark chrome.
