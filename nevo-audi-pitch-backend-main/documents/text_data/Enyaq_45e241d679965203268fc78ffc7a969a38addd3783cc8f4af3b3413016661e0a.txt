Škoda Enyaq Coupé: Travel Assist Lane Keeping Assist The Lane Keeping Assist detects when you unintentionally drift out of your lane. This system operates in conjunction with a camera to recognize road markings, including yellow lines in construction zones, traffic cones, and other road edges or lane boundaries. The enhanced "adaptive" version of Lane Keeping Assist (only available as part of the Traveller package) actively intervenes in the driving process to keep the vehicle in the selected lane without causing the vehicle to "swerve."
