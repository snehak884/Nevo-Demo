Škoda Kodiaq – Safety Emergency Call Function The Kodiaq features the automatic emergency call function "Emergency Call," which is free of charge for the entire lifespan of the vehicle. Once the airbag control unit registers a severe accident, the vehicle automatically sends an emergency call to the emergency center. Data such as location, direction, number of vehicle occupants, and severity of the accident are transmitted, enabling appropriate emergency services to arrive as quickly as possible. The system can also be manually activated at any time using buttons in the roof module.
