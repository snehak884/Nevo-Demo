Kodiaq-› The Trailer Stability Assist (TSA) is active when the vehicle is equipped with an original trailer hitch with its own control system. The system operates on the principle that it brakes one or more wheels and reduces engine torque if necessary. Here, the TSA system intervenes and helps the driver stabilize the car and trailer. › The Advanced Electronic Differential Lock (XDS+) assists the driver in sharp turns and ensures a neutral vehicle behavior during dynamic cornering. The control electronics simulate the presence of a self-locking differential to improve traction and driving dynamics in curves. Therefore, the vehicle moves significantly more safely and naturally in curves. › The Tire Pressure Monitoring System (TPM+) keeps the driver informed about the tire pressure at all times. › The Hill Start Assist supports the driver when starting on a hill. From an incline of five percent, the system automatically activates and ensures easy and comfortable hill starts without the use of the handbrake. This effectively prevents the vehicle from rolling backward or stalling the engine. › Flashing brake lights reduce the risk of rear-end collisions, especially when approaching traffic jams on highways or during sudden braking maneuvers in front of obstacles.
