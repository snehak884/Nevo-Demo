Škoda Kodiaq – Assistance Systems  Adaptive Distance Assistant "Adaptive Cruise Control" The adaptive distance assistant ("Adaptive Cruise Control" ACC) recognizes speed limits based on traffic signs and automatically adjusts the speed of the vehicle. For example, if you are driving your vehicle on the highway and reach an urban area, the valid speed limit there will be maintained. Only when leaving the city does the assistant switch back to the highway's maximum speed.
