Škoda Kodiaq – Assistance Systems Travel Assist If you occasionally sit behind the wheel for hours, you may know how difficult it can be to constantly pay attention to signs, drive in heavy traffic, or stay focused in creeping traffic during a jam. The Travel Assist supports you in this and increases your driving comfort with its systems and functions. Once the functions are activated, Travel Assist automatically keeps your Škoda in lane, adjusts speed, or coordinates braking and starting in traffic jam situations.
