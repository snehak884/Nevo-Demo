Škoda Enyaq Coupé: Technology   Driving modes and adjustable chassis   As is common with other Škoda models, the Enyaq Coupé is available with Driving Mode Select. Depending on the version, there are 5 or 6 driving modes available. For the version with rear-wheel drive, the following modes are available: Eco, Comfort, Normal, Sport, and Individual. The version with all-wheel drive additionally has a traction mode. With Driving Mode Select, one can control not only the throttle response of the vehicle but also the available torque, top speed, power steering, and the strength of the air conditioning system.   In combination with the optionally available Dynamic Chassis Control (DCC), the chosen driving mode also affects the chassis settings. DCC constantly evaluates the current driving situation and responds accordingly by adjusting the shock absorbers for each wheel separately.
