Škoda Enyaq Coupé: Assistance Systems Exit Warning The exit warning is a new, supplementary function of the Side Assist: It warns you and other passengers visually and acoustically when exiting, for example, from a parallel parked vehicle if opening the door could lead to a collision with another vehicle, a cyclist, or an electric scooter. The exit warning uses the rear radar sensors of the Side Assist and monitors the area behind and at the sides of the vehicle at a distance of up to 35 meters.
