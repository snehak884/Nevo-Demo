Škoda Superb – Safety Takes Priority Airbags and Impact Protection In the event of an accident, passengers are protected by the robust body with generous crumple zones and up to ten airbags. These offer a finely tuned interaction with three-point automatic seat belts and safety headrests. Additional safety features include modern electronic systems that mitigate the consequences of an accident. These include, for example, the multi-collision brake and the proactive occupant protection system in the front and rear.
