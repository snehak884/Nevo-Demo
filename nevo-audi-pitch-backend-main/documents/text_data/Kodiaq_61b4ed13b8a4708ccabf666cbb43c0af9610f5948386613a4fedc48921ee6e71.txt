Škoda Kodiaq – Interior  Quality and ecological responsibility in harmony Every component in the interior of the Kodiaq has been crafted with the utmost care and high-quality materials, while prioritizing more environmentally friendly processes. For example, the leather in the Suite trim is tanned with remnants from coffee bean production, and the Lounge design uses 40% natural wool. All textiles in all interior trims are made from 100% recycled polyester. Even the umbrella and the ice scraper are made from recycled materials.
