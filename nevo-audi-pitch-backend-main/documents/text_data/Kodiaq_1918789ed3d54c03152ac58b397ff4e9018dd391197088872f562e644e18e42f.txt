Kodiaq-Safety Safety Features The Škoda Superb stands for uncompromising safety. In addition to the already mentioned safety systems, the following features are available as standard or as an option: › Anchor points for Isofix and Top Tether are used for securing child seats on the outer rear seats. Isofix is also available for the front passenger seat. › Unlike the cruise control, which maintains a set value, the speed limiter allows driving at any speed – of course, only up to the set limit. › The anti-lock braking system (ABS) prevents the wheels from locking during hard braking or braking on slippery surfaces. › By increasing the brake pressure, the hydraulic brake assist (HBA) supports the driver during emergency braking maneuvers. This can significantly shorten the braking distance. › The electronic brakeforce distribution (EBV) automatically optimizes the brake pressure and the overall brake force distribution, preventing the rear wheels from decelerating too quickly. › The engine drag torque control (MSR) counteracts the tendency of the driven wheels to lock, which can occur when braking on slippery roads. › The traction control system (ASR) enables smooth starting and acceleration on slippery roads without wheel spin. › The electronic differential lock (EDS) assists during acceleration and driving on a hill with low traction under one of the drive wheels.
