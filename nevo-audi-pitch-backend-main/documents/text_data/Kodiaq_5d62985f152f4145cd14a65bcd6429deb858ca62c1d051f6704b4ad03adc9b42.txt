Škoda Kodiaq – Design   Shine and Elegance   The front of the Kodiaq is dominated by second-generation Matrix LED headlights with a four-eye design. If desired, these can be visually connected by a horizontal light strip in the grille, creating a unique light signature. The front spoiler made of robust fine-grain plastic, the wide, honeycomb-shaped air intake framed by two cubic air intakes, the massive, octagonal grille, and the sculptural shapes of the hood underscore the powerful presence of the Kodiaq.
