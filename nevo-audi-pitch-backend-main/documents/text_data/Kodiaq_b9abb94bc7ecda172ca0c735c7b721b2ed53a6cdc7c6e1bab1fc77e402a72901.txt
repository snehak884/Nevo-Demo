Škoda Kodiaq - Design  Distinctively dynamic silhouette  The aerodynamically optimized and elongated roofline, complemented by a flat, silver-painted roof rail, immediately catches the eye in the side view. The tornado line running along the side contributes to the dynamic appearance of the Kodiaq, while the strongly contoured bodywork, running over the front and rear wheels and thus accentuating the wheel arches, emphasizes its robustness. The stylish and powerful design is further enhanced by wheels up to 20" in size, as well as angular wheel arches and door sills made of grained black plastic.
