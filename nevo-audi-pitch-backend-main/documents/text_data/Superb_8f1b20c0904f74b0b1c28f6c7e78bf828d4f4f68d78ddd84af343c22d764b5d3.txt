Škoda Superb – Assistance Systems   Lane Keeping Assistant "Adaptive Lane Assist"   The Lane Keeping Assistant ("Adaptive Lane Assist") detects when you unintentionally leave the driving lane. This system works in conjunction with a camera to recognize road markings on the street, including yellow lines in construction zones, traffic barrels, and other road edges or lane boundaries. The advanced "adaptive" version of the Lane Keeping Assistant (available only as part of the Traveller package) actively intervenes in the driving process to keep the vehicle in the selected lane without causing the vehicle to "swerve."
