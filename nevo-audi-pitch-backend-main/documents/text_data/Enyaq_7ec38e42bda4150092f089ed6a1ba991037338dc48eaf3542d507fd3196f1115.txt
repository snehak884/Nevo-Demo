Škoda Enyaq Coupé: Interior You can not only drive green The Enyaq Coupé has nature in mind not only with its CO₂ emissions-free operation but also by using environmentally friendly materials in the interior. For example, the cognac-colored seats are made of genuine leather tanned with olive leaves, which would otherwise be considered waste and cannot be reused. In the Design Selection Lodge, the seats are made of 40% certified natural wool, with the remaining 60% made of polyester derived from recycled plastic bottles.
