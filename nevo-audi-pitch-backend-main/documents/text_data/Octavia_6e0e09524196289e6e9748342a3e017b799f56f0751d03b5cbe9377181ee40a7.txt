Octavia Combi – Function meets Design Quality and ecological responsibility in harmony Every part of the interior was crafted with the greatest care and from high-quality materials, with eco-friendly processes taking center stage. For example, the leather in the Suite Design Selection is tanned using residues from coffee bean production. Many details are also finished in a unique Unique Dark Chrome, a refinement that is more environmentally friendly than conventional chroming.
