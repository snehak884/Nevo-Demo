Škoda Enyaq Coupé: Travel Assist Evasive Assistant for City Traffic  The evasive assistant is capable of recognizing everyday situations in city traffic, such as parked vehicles, traffic islands, and intersections. It relies on data from online communication. The assistant is used in situations where an accident cannot be prevented by simply avoiding the obstacle. The system is able to calculate the most suitable driving line based on data from the front camera and radar. This calculation takes into account the distance, width, and position of the vehicle or obstacle ahead. In a critical situation, where the front radar assistant (see safety assistants) intervenes by braking and it is apparent from the steering wheel movement that an evasive maneuver is being initiated, the evasive assistant takes targeted control of the steering to avoid the obstacle. It follows an appropriately chosen driving line to avoid colliding with the obstacle.
