Škoda Kodiaq - LED Technology Matrix-LED Headlights The high-end headlights also use LEDs for all functions, but they are more powerful than standard headlights and additionally feature the pioneering Matrix function. The Matrix-LED headlights have the same four-eye design as the basic LED headlights, but unlike those, the hexagonal modules are complemented by Crystallinium™—a brand-new feature inspired by colored crystalline glass, which gives the headlights a new sense of color.
