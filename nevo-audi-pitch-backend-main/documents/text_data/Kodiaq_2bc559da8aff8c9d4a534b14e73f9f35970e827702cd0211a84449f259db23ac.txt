Kodiaq-› XDS+ supports sharp curves and ensures a neutral behavior of the vehicle during dynamic cornering. The control electronics essentially simulate the presence of a self-locking differential to improve traction and driving dynamics in curves. This allows the vehicle to take curves much more safely and naturally. › The tire pressure monitoring system TPM+ provides information about the prevailing tire pressure at any time. › The optional Hill-Hold Control assists with safe hill starts. The system activates at a gradient of five degrees and ensures easy and safe starting on inclines without the need to engage the handbrake. The system prevents the vehicle from rolling backward or stalling. › Flashing brake lights reduce the risk of a rear-end collision, especially when approaching a traffic jam on the highway or when braking suddenly before an unexpected obstacle.
