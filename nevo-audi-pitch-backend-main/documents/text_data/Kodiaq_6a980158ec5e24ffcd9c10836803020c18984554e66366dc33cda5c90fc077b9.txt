Škoda Kodiaq – Easy Parking Intelligent Park Assist System The new intelligent park assist system can automatically park the Kodiaq in parallel and perpendicular parking spaces. In addition to steering, it now also controls the vehicle's speed and stops automatically when the system detects an obstacle. When reversing, the new automatic emergency braking assistant for pedestrians behind the vehicle takes over, which will soon be available for the Kodiaq.
