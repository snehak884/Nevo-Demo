Škoda Enyaq Coupé: E-Mobility Charging Options The Enyaq Coupé is equipped with a combined charging socket. The battery can be charged from AC sources with a charging capacity of up to 11 k W (when charging at the Škoda Wallbox) or from DC sources with a peak charging capacity of up to 135 k W (at public fast charging stations). The infrastructure for operating electric vehicles is growing daily. Škoda is also involved in building the Europe-wide IONITY network. In addition to conventional external charging, the Enyaq Coupé is capable of recovering braking energy. In this process, the vehicle's kinetic energy is converted into electricity and stored in the high-voltage battery.
