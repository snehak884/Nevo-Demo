Škoda Enyaq Coupé: Travel Assist Traffic Sign Recognition An image processing module scans images for known traffic signs and compares the results with the navigation data. The system processes speed limit signs, no-overtaking signs, no-entry signs in one-way streets, and all supplementary instructions as well as the corresponding end of restriction signs and displays them to the driver.
