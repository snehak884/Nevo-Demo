Recovery of braking energy During regenerative braking, the kinetic energy of the vehicle is converted into electricity, which is then stored in the high-voltage battery. In this way, energy is used efficiently, and the range of the vehicle is increased by partially charging the battery during driving. Regenerative braking occurs in various driving situations and features multiple modes that can be changed at any time. The intensity of the regenerative braking force can be manually adjusted by the driver or automatically by the vehicle's control unit.  Progressive steering This feature gives the Enyaq Coupé better handling and more agility in curves. The progressive steering changes the ratio depending on how far the steering wheel is turned.  Self-sealing tires The vehicle comes standard with a tire repair kit or with tires designed to seal damaged treads immediately and without pressure loss, standard for 20''- and 21''-wheels.
