Drive and Steering All-Wheel Drive The rear-axle-mounted electric motor can be complemented by a second electric motor on the front axle. This gives the Enyaq Coupé an all-wheel drive. The front-wheel drive is switched on and off fully automatically, and the driver can influence the behavior of the all-wheel drive to a certain extent by choosing the driving mode - Sport, Eco, Comfort, Normal, Individual, or Traction. The all-wheel drive consumes only slightly more energy than the rear-wheel drive. This higher energy consumption is mainly due to the additional weight of the front motor. This design of the all-wheel drive is more energy-efficient than the traditional arrangement with a central axle differential and universal joint. The all-wheel drive is only available with the largest battery (77 k Wh).
