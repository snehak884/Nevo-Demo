Škoda Kodiaq - Clever Trunk Space Cargo Elements In the best Škoda tradition, the trunk space of the Kodiaq also offers plenty of practical features. Items can be secured in the trunk with cargo elements. Simply place your boxes and groceries between the individual elements. This makes slipping hardly possible anymore. The cargo elements can be folded away and stored under the trunk floor or the variable loading floor.
