Škoda Kodiaq – Connectivity Smart Link Škoda's Wireless Smart Link technology allows for the wireless connection of smartphones with the vehicle's infotainment system. This enables certain functions of the mobile device, such as navigation, music, or calls, to be controlled directly via the infotainment system without having to physically connect the smartphone, meaning without using a USB cable. Wireless Smart Link is based on the "Mirror Link" standard of the Car Connectivity Consortium (CCC) and works with all common smartphones and the two operating systems Android (Android Auto) and i OS (Apple Car Play). Additionally, thanks to Smart Link+, you can access interesting live data of your drive, such as fuel consumption, driving dynamics, or service information, anytime in the MyŠkoda app.
