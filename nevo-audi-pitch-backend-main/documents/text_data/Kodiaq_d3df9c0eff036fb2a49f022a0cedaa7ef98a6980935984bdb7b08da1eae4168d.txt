Škoda Kodiaq – Interior  Simple Beauty  The driver area of the Kodiaq is dominated by the multifunction steering wheel, which features the new Škoda 2D logo at its center and is equipped with decorative elements in a unique dark matte chrome color. The modern, freestanding touchscreen of the infotainment system protrudes from the dashboard so that you always have it in view. By moving the automatic gearshift to the steering wheel, the center console offers more space and looks tidier. The ambient lighting in the dashboard and door panels contributes to the feel-good atmosphere of the interior.
