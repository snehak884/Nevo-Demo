Škoda Superb – modern design Fascinating beauty The Škoda Superb presents itself in a beautiful design with sleek yet clearly defined contours and new Matrix LED headlights in a crystalline design – a homage to Bohemian crystal craftsmanship. The striking front bumper, the octagonal radiator grille with its boldly shaped frame in Unique Dark Chrome, and the centrally ribbed hood dominated by the new Škoda logo give the Superb a fresh and distinctive appearance.
