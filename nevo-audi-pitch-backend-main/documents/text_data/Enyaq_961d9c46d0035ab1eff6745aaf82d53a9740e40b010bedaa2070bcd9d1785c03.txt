Dynamic Chassis Control with Driving Mode Select For maximum driving pleasure, the Enyaq Coupé can be equipped with dynamic chassis control with Driving Mode Select. The vehicle offers several modes that change both the sensitivity of the dampers and other vehicle settings. At the push of a button, the vehicle can thus be switched from a comfortable, relaxed setting to a dynamic, sporty one. The Dynamic Chassis Control continuously monitors, evaluates, and responds to the current driving behavior (braking, accelerating, turning) and adjusts the damping characteristics for each wheel individually and independently depending on the selected mode.
