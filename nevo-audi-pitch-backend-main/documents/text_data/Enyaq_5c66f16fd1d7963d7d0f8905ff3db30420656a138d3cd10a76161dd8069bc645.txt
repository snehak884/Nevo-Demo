Enyaq Coupé: Clever Details Holder for Safety Vests You're probably familiar with the safety instructions on an airplane, where you're informed about the life vest under your seat. At Škoda, we now offer you something similar and simply clever for the road: it might not inflate, but its reflective material can save lives at night. The safety vest is securely stored in specially designed holders in the front and rear doors, so it's quick and easy to reach.
