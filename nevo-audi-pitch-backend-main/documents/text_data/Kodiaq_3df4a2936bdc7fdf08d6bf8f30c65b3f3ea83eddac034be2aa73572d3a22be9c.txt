Kodiaq-Recovery of Brake Energy During regenerative braking, the vehicle's kinetic energy is converted into electricity, which is then stored in the high-voltage battery. This allows for efficient use of energy and increases the vehicle's range by partially charging the battery while driving. Regenerative braking occurs in various driving situations and has multiple modes that can be changed at any time. The intensity of the regenerative braking force can be manually adjusted by the driver or automatically by the vehicle's control unit.  Progressive Steering This function gives the Enyaq Coupé better handling and more agility in curves. The progressive steering changes the ratio depending on how far the steering wheel is turned.  Self-Sealing Tires The vehicle is equipped as standard with either a tire repair kit or tires designed to seal damaged treads immediately and without pressure loss, standard for 20"- and 21"-wheels.
