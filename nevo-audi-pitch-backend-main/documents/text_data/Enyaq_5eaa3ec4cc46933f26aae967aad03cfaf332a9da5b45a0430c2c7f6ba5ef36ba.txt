Škoda Enyaq Coupé: Assistance Systems Front Radar Assistant including City Emergency Braking Function The Front Radar Assistant is an assistance system with collision warning: When faced with an unavoidable collision, it brakes the vehicle to minimize the consequences. It also performs an emergency brake when a pedestrian or cyclist attempts to cross the vehicle's path. In a critical situation, the Front Radar Assistant intervenes by braking. The Front Radar Assistant recognizes by the way the driver moves the steering wheel that they are trying to avoid an obstacle, and actively intervenes in steering to circumvent it.
