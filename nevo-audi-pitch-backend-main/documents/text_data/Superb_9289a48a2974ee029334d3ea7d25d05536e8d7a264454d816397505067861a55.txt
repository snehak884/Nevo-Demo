Škoda Superb – Easy Parking  "Intelligent Park Assist"  The new intelligent park assist ("Intelligent Park Assist") can almost automatically park the Superb in parking spaces both parallel and perpendicular to the road. In addition to steering, it now also controls the speed of the vehicle and stops automatically when the system detects an obstacle. All you need to do is select the right gear and accelerate. When reversing, the new automatic emergency brake assistant for pedestrians behind the vehicle, which will soon be available for the Superb, takes over.
