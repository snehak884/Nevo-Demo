Škoda Superb – Clever Cargo Area Cargo Elements In the best Škoda tradition, the cargo area of the Superb also offers plenty of practical features. Items can be easily secured with cargo elements. Simply place your boxes and purchases between the individual elements. This prevents them from sliding around. The cargo elements can be folded away and stored under the cargo floor or the variable loading floor.
