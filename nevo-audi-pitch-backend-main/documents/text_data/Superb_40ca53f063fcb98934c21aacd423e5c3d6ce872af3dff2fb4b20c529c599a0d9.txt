Safety Safety Features The Škoda Superb stands for uncompromising safety. In addition to the previously mentioned safety systems, the following features are available as standard or optional: › Anchor points for Isofix and Top Tether are used to attach child seats on the outer rear seats. Isofix is also available for the front passenger seat. › Unlike the cruise control, which maintains a set value, the speed limiter allows driving at any speed - of course, only up to the set limit. › The anti-lock braking system (ABS) prevents the wheels from locking during emergency braking or when braking on slippery surfaces. › By increasing brake pressure, the hydraulic brake assist (HBA) supports the driver during emergency braking maneuvers. This can significantly shorten the braking distance. › The electronic brakeforce distribution (EBV) automatically optimizes the brake pressure and overall brake force distribution, preventing the rear wheels from braking too quickly. › The engine drag torque control (MSR) counteracts the tendency of the driven wheels to block, which can occur when braking on a slippery surface. › The traction control system (ASR) enables smooth starting and acceleration on slippery surfaces without spinning wheels. › The electronic differential lock (EDS) assists with acceleration and driving on a hill with low traction under the driven wheels. › The trailer stability assist (TSA) is active when the vehicle is equipped with an original trailer hitch with its own control unit. The system works on the principle of braking one of the wheels and, if necessary, simultaneously reducing the engine torque. Here, the TSA system intervenes and helps the driver stabilize the car and trailer.
