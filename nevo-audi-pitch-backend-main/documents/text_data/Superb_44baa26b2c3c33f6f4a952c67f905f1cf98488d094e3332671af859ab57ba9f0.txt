Škoda Superb — Easy Parking Trailer Maneuvering Assistant "Trailer Assist" With the trailer maneuvering assistant ("Trailer Assist"), nothing can go wrong when maneuvering at the campsite or performing maneuvers in front of a curious audience. Simply set the steering angle for reversing via the exterior mirror adjustment of your Škoda. For orientation, a graphic with the trailer's steering angle is displayed on the onboard display. All you, as the driver, need to do is gently accelerate - the system takes care of the rest and steers your vehicle with the trailer automatically in the desired direction.
