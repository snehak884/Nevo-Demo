Škoda Kodiaq – Assistance Systems Lane Keeping Assist "Adaptive Lane Assist" The lane keeping assistant ("Adaptive Lane Assist") detects when you unintentionally deviate from your lane. This system works in conjunction with a camera to recognize lane markings on the road, including yellow lines in construction zones, traffic cones, and other road edges or lane boundaries. The extended "adaptive" version of the lane keeping assistant (available only as part of the Traveller package) actively intervenes in the driving process to keep the vehicle in the selected lane without the vehicle "swerving."
