Škoda Superb – Smart and Spacious Quality and Ecological Responsibility in Harmony Every single interior part of the Superb has been created with the utmost care and high-quality materials, with a focus on more environmentally friendly processes. For instance, the leather used in the eco Suite Cognac design selection is dyed with extracts from the leaves of the olive tree. All textiles in the interior are made from 100% recycled polyester. Even the umbrella and the ice scraper are partially made from recycled materials.
