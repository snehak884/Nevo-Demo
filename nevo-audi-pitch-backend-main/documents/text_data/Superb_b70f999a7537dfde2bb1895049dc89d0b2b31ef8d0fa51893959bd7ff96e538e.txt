Superb-The extended electronic differential lock (XDS+) supports the driver in sharp turns and ensures neutral vehicle behavior during dynamic cornering. The control electronics simulate the presence of a self-locking differential to improve traction and driving dynamics in curves. Therefore, the vehicle moves significantly safer and more naturally in curves. With the tire pressure monitoring system (TPM+), the driver is always informed about the tire pressure. The hill-start assist supports the driver when starting on a hill. From a gradient of five percent, the system automatically engages, ensuring easy and comfortable hill starts without using the handbrake. This effectively prevents the vehicle from rolling back or stalling the engine. Flashing brake lights reduce the risk of rear-end collisions, especially when approaching the end of traffic jams on highways or during sudden braking maneuvers in front of obstacles.
