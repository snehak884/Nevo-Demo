› The advanced electronic differential lock (XDS+) supports the driver in sharp turns and ensures a neutral behavior of the vehicle during dynamic cornering. The control electronics simulate the presence of a self-locking differential to enhance traction and driving dynamics in curves. Therefore, the vehicle moves significantly safer and more naturally in curves. › The tire pressure monitoring system (TPM+) keeps the driver informed about the tire pressure at all times. › The hill start assist supports the driver when starting on a hill. From a gradient of five percent, the system activates automatically and ensures easy and comfortable hill starts without the use of the handbrake. This effectively prevents the vehicle from rolling back or the engine from stalling. › Flashing brake lights reduce the risk of rear-end collisions, especially when approaching traffic jams on highways or during sudden braking maneuvers in front of obstacles. Drive and Steering All-Wheel Drive The Škoda Superb is equipped with the latest generation of electronically controlled multi-plate clutch. The state-of-the-art all-wheel drive ensures optimal driving dynamics, maximum active safety, and low fuel consumption. The distribution of driving power to all four wheels occurs automatically and depends on the driving conditions. The ideal torque for the rear axle is calculated by the control unit. Adjustments are possible through variable pressure on the clutch engagement.
