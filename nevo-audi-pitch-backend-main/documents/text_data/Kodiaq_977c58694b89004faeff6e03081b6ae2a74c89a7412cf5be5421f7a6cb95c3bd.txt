Safety  Safety Features  The Škoda Kodiaq stands for uncompromising safety. In addition to the already described safety systems, the following features are available as standard or optional equipment: › Isofix and Top Tether anchor points for securing a child seat on the outer seats of the second row. Isofix is also available for the front passenger seat. › Unlike the cruise control system, which maintains a set speed, the driver can use the speed limiter to drive up to a certain speed, which must not be exceeded. › ABS prevents the wheels from locking during emergency braking or when braking on slippery surfaces. › By increasing brake pressure, the brake assist intervenes in situations where full braking is required. This can significantly shorten the braking distance. › MSR counteracts the blocking of the drive wheels, which can occur when the vehicle is braked on a smooth surface. › ASR ensures smooth starting and acceleration without the wheels spinning on slippery surfaces. › TSA becomes active when the vehicle is equipped with an original towing device with its own control unit. The system works on the principle of braking one or more wheels while simultaneously reducing engine torque if necessary. The TSA system intervenes and helps stabilize the vehicle and trailer.
