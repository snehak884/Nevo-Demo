Enyaq Coupé: Easy Parking Intelligent parking assistant with parking aid A new feature of the intelligent parking assistant is the parking aid, which automatically performs a parking maneuver into a parking space in a familiar environment, such as at home. The vehicle controls the steering, braking, and driving direction (forward or backward), while constantly monitoring the surroundings, recognizing objects and pedestrians, and thus preventing collisions. The parking aid works in known environments over a greater distance of up to 50 meters.
