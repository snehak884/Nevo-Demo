Škoda Kodiaq – Easy Parking Trailer Maneuvering Assistant "Trailer Assist" With the trailer maneuvering assistant ("Trailer Assist"), nothing can go wrong when maneuvering at the campsite or in front of curious onlookers. All you have to do is set the steering angle for reversing using your Škoda's exterior mirror adjustment. A graphic displaying the trailer's steering angle will be shown on the onboard display for orientation. All you need to do as the driver is to gently accelerate – the system will take care of the rest and steer your vehicle with the trailer automatically in the desired direction.
