Škoda Superb – Safety Assistants Proactive Occupant Protection "Crew Protect Assist" The proactive occupant protection ("Crew Protect Assist") detects critical situations with accident potential and automatically takes precautions depending on the situation. In the event of an impending collision or unstable driving situations, the safety belts in the front seats are instantly tightened to secure the driver and front passenger. Additionally, in conjunction with the electronic stability control (ESC), the system almost completely closes the side windows and the panoramic roof. This prevents foreign objects from entering the vehicle interior. The system uses the front radar.
