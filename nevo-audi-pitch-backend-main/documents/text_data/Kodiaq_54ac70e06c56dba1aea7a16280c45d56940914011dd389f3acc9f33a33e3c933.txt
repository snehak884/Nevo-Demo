Škoda Kodiaq - Safety Assistants Proactive Occupant Protection "Crew Protect Assist" The proactive occupant protection ("Crew Protect Assist") detects critical situations with accident potential and automatically takes precautions depending on the situation. In the event of an impending collision or unstable driving situations, the safety belts on the front seats are tightened in an instant to secure the driver and front passenger. Additionally, the system, in conjunction with the electronic stability control (ESC), almost completely closes the side windows and the panoramic roof. This prevents foreign objects from entering the vehicle interior. The system uses the front radar.
