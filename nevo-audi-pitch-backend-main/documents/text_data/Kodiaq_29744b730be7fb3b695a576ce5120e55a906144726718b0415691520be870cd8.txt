Škoda Kodiaq - Easy Parking Trained Park Assist The Trained Park Assist function offers automatic parking maneuvers into a parking space located in a familiar environment, such as at home. The vehicle automatically controls the steering, brakes, and driving direction (forward or backward) while continuously monitoring the surroundings, detecting obstacles and pedestrians, and preventing collisions with them. This allows the vehicle, with the help of the assistant, to park in a known environment over a greater distance (up to 50 meters) into a parking space.
