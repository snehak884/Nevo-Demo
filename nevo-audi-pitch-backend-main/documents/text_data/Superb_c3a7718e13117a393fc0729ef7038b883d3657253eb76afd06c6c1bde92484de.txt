Škoda Superb – Assistance Systems Adaptive Distance Assistant "Adaptive Cruise Control" The adaptive distance assistant ("Adaptive Cruise Control" ACC) recognizes speed limits based on traffic signs and automatically adjusts the vehicle's speed. For example, if you are driving on the highway and reach a metropolitan area, the speed limit valid there will be observed. Only when leaving the city does the assistant switch back to the maximum speed on the highway.
