Škoda Kodiaq – Clever Technology USB-C port in the rearview mirror If you record traffic in front of you using a dashcam, you will appreciate the optional USB-C port in the rearview mirror. Thanks to this, you have a power source right next to the camera, which eliminates the need for long cables running through the vehicle and obstructing your view.
