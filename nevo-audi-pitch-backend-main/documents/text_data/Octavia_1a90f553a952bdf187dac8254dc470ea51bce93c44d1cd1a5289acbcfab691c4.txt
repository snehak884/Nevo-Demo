Škoda Octavia Combi – Travel Assist Adaptive Lane Keeping Assistant "Adaptive Lane Assist" This system detects road markings on the street, including yellow lines at construction sites, traffic cones, and other roadside or lane boundaries. If you unintentionally leave the lane, it actively intervenes to bring the vehicle back into the selected lane without "fishtailing."
