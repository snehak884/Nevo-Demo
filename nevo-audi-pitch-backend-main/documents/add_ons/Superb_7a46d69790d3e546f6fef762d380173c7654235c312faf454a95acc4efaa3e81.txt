Škoda Superb – Clever Technology USB-C port in the rearview mirror If you record the traffic in front of you using a camera, you will appreciate the optional USB-C port in the rearview mirror. Thanks to this, you have a power source right next to the camera, eliminating the need for long cables running through the vehicle and obstructing the view.
