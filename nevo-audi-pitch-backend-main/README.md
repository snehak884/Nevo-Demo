# nevo-audi-pitch-backend

This is the backend for the Nevo demo built for the Audi pitches and Skoda offering, based on the Nevo framework.

The backend was originally developed monolithically as ["Skoda sales bot"](https://github.com/diconium/skoda-sales-bot), with core Nevo framework and Audi use-case code separated only into different packages. The code was then refactored to turn the [Nevo Backend Framework](https://github.com/diconium/nevo-backend-framework) into a use-case independent library, with the Audi use-case code separated into this repo.

To run and install this, see follow the instructions in the [Nevo Backend Framework](https://github.com/diconium/nevo-backend-framework).

The frontend is available in a separate [Nevo Audi Pitch Frontend](https://github.com/diconium/skoda-sales-bot-frontend) repo.
